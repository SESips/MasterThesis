This repository contains all code for my master thesis: "Design Principles for Data Quality Assessment in OMOP Conversion Pipelines: Action Design Research Study at the National Cancer Registry."

The main folder contains sub-folders organized per intervention. For intervention 1, R code was written. For interventions 2 and 3, Python and SQL (PostrgreSQL and SQL Server) code was made.
